# EV Market Segmentation 🚗⚡

## 📊 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and segment the Indian EV market using real-world data, clustering algorithms, and consumer profiling to identify the most optimal segments for targeting early EV adopters.

---

## 🔍 Fermi Estimation
Estimated early market size using logical assumptions:
- Population basis, middle-class segmentation, inclination toward EVs, and early adoption percentages.
- Estimated **850,000 early adopters**.

## 📂 Data Sources
- Kaggle: EV_Dataset.csv  
- Kaggle: Charging_station_dataset.csv

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization  
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ⚙️ Process Flow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Null handling, standardization, encoding  
2. **Segmentation**  
   - KMeans clustering  
   - Elbow method for optimal k  
   - PCA for cluster visualization  
3. **Profiling Segments**  
   - 4 clusters: Budget, Premium, Eco-conscious, Rural  
4. **Target Segment Selection**  
   - Cluster 1 & 2 chosen for early rollout
